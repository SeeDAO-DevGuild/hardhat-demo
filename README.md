# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

# Compile all contracts (.sol) in the contracts folder and generate artifacts and cache
pnpm run compile

# Test contracts according to all scripts (.ts) in the scripts folder
pnpm run test

# Deploy contracts according to the configuration in hardhat.config.ts
pnpm run deploy

```
